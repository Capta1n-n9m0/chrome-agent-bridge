/**
 * Step 9 (Phase E), S2b: the toolbar button's badge and title, and the one log line per press.
 *
 * - `badgeOf` is pure: disarmed → `OFF` red; armed with JavaScript off → `JS` amber; armed → no badge; `OFF`
 *   wins (F37); a state that cannot be read → `OFF` (fail closed) (decisions.md · 2026-10-24 · Badge and
 *   title (#143)). A disarm whose write failed (`"write-failed"`, #174) and an arm whose write was rejected
 *   are `OFF` too, with titles that say so.
 * - `BadgeModel` keeps such a failure visible until the state moves on (a read that says armed, or the next
 *   saved press). A `write-failed` note also ends once storage itself reads disarmed (the OFF was saved
 *   later, e.g. by the options page; S2b verifier F5): the gate's read cannot show that, since a disarm held
 *   in memory masks the stored value (#176). The badge stays `OFF` either way.
 * - `BadgeController` is the thin glue: `press` runs the toggle (the button and the `_execute_action`
 *   shortcut, #142), logs one content-free line, then re-derives the badge from a fresh read; `refresh` is
 *   the worker start's and every safety change's (F42, #144). It never throws synchronously, and a press
 *   never rejects.
 *
 * Nothing here sees a pattern, a URL, a title of a tab or the token: only the two switches (phase doc 0.7).
