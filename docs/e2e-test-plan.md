# End-to-End Test Plan

- **Date:** 2026-06-04
- **Scope:** Validate the Chrome Agent Bridge against a **real Chrome instance + real MCP client**.
- **Why manual:** these paths can't be unit-tested — they need the actual browser, the extension
  loaded in a real profile, and a live MCP connection. The 46 automated tests cover logic/protocol;
  this plan covers the rest.

Each test has an **ID**, **objective**, **steps** (as MCP tool calls), and an **expected result**.
Record outcomes in the [Results template](#results-template). A run "passes" when all **must-pass**
(★) cases pass.

## 1. Environment & preconditions

1. **Versions:** Chrome ≥ 116, Node ≥ 20.
2. **Build:** from the repo root — `npm install && npm run build`. Confirm
   `server/dist/index.js` and `extension/dist/{sw,options,offscreen,content}.js` exist.
3. **Token:** choose a secret, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 16`. Call it `<TOKEN>`.
4. **Register the MCP server** in your client (see `docs/setup.md` §3) with env
   `BRIDGE_TOKEN=<TOKEN>`, `BRIDGE_PORT=9234`. (Or run the inspector:
   `$env:BRIDGE_TOKEN="<TOKEN>"; npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node server/dist/index.js`.)
5. **Load the extension:** `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked → select
   `extension/`.
6. **Configure the extension:** open its Options, set Port `9234` + Token `<TOKEN>`, Save.
7. **Serve the fixture** (for the deterministic cases) from the repo root:
   - `python -m http.server 8080 --directory test-fixtures` → fixture at
     `http://localhost:8080/e2e-playground.html`
   - or `npx http-server test-fixtures -p 8080`.
   Using `http://localhost` avoids the "allow file URLs" toggle and lets the extension inject.

**Fixture reference:** `test-fixtures/e2e-playground.html` exposes a sticky `status:` line that
updates on every interaction (so `browser_snapshot` / `browser_screenshot` can verify outcomes), a
labeled form, a synthetic-friendly counter button, a **trusted-only** button (flips only on a real
`isTrusted` event), a hover target, a jump link, a 1.5 s **async** loader, and a long region with a
`BOTTOM MARKER` for scroll / full-page screenshots.

## 2. Diagnostics (where to look when something fails)

- **Extension service-worker console:** `chrome://extensions` → the extension → "service worker".
  Expect `[bridge] connection: up`. Errors from handlers surface here.
- **Server stderr:** the terminal/inspector running the MCP server. Expect the
  `WebSocket host listening on 127.0.0.1:9234` line.
- **MCP client tool output:** the text/image each tool returns, or an error envelope.
- **Offscreen document:** `chrome://extensions` → the extension → it may list "offscreen.html"
  as an active view; its console shows WS activity.

## 3. Smoke test (run this first) ★

| ID | Objective | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| SMOKE-1 | The whole loop works | With everything from §1 running, call `browser_navigate {"url":"http://localhost:8080/e2e-playground.html"}` | Active tab loads the playground; tool returns "Navigated active tab to …". SW console shows `connection: up`. |
| SMOKE-2 | Perception works | `browser_snapshot` | Returns a text outline including `textbox "Email address" [ref=…]`, `button "Sign in" [ref=…]`, `combobox "Favorite fruit" [ref=…]`, and the `status: idle` text. |

If SMOKE-1/2 fail, stop and debug connection/injection before the rest.

## 4. Test cases

### 4.1 Connection & handshake

| ID | Objective | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| CONN-1 ★ | Extension connects | Start server, ensure token set in Options | SW console: `connection: up`. |
| CONN-2 ★ | Not-connected error is clear | Stop the server (or disable the extension), then call any tool | Tool returns an error like "Extension not connected — is Chrome open and the … extension enabled?" |
| CONN-3 ★ | Reconnect after server restart | With it connected, stop and restart the MCP server | Within a few seconds SW logs `connection: down` then `up`; a subsequent `browser_snapshot` works without touching the extension. |
| CONN-4 | Wrong token rejected | In Options set a wrong token, Save | SW logs `connection: down`/retries; tools return not-connected. Restore the correct token → reconnects. |
| CONN-5 | Idle keepalive (offscreen) | Connect, then leave Chrome idle / switch away for 3+ minutes | A `browser_snapshot` afterward still works (the offscreen document kept the socket alive). |

### 4.2 Navigation

| ID | Objective | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| NAV-1 ★ | Navigate normal page | `browser_navigate {"url":"https://example.com"}` | Active tab shows example.com; tool confirms. |
| NAV-2 | Navigate fast/cached page | Navigate to the playground twice in a row | Both calls return promptly (no ~30 s hang — validates the load-listener-before-navigate fix). |
| NAV-3 | Restricted URL is handled | Manually focus a `chrome://settings` tab, then call `browser_snapshot` | Tool returns a clear "restricted URL (chrome://, New Tab, Web Store)…" error, not a hang/crash. |

### 4.3 Perception

| ID | Objective | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| PERC-1 ★ | Refs + roles | On the playground, `browser_snapshot` | Lists textbox/combobox/button/link entries with `[ref=eN]`. |
| PERC-2 ★ | Label-based naming | Inspect the snapshot text | Email input is `textbox "Email address"` (via `<label for>`); password is named "Password" (via `aria-labelledby`); search shows its placeholder. |
| PERC-3 ★ | Viewport screenshot | `browser_screenshot` | Returns a PNG of the current viewport that renders in the client. |
| PERC-4 | Full-page screenshot + banner | `browser_screenshot {"fullPage":true}` | Returns a taller PNG that includes the `BOTTOM MARKER`; the "extension is debugging this browser" banner appears briefly, then clears. |

### 4.4 Actions (content-script path)

| ID | Objective | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| ACT-1 ★ | Type into a field | snapshot → `browser_type {"ref":"<email ref>","text":"a@b.com"}` | Email field shows the text; `status:` line reads `email = a@b.com` (verify via another snapshot). |
| ACT-2 ★ | Click a button | `browser_click {"ref":"<counter ref>"}` | Counter increments; `status: counter = 1`. |
| ACT-3 | Type + submit | `browser_type {"ref":"<email ref>","text":"x@y.com","submit":true}` | `status: form submitted (email = x@y.com)`. |
| ACT-4 | Select option | `browser_select_option {"ref":"<fruit ref>","values":["Banana"]}` | `status: fruit = b`. (Also try `["c"]` by value.) |
| ACT-5 | Hover | `browser_hover {"ref":"<hover-target ref>"}` | `status: hovered`. |
| ACT-6 | Scroll | `browser_scroll {"direction":"down"}` then `browser_screenshot` | Viewport shows lower content / `BOTTOM MARKER` region. |
| ACT-7 | Press key | Focus a field via click, then `browser_press_key {"key":"Enter"}` | No error; if on the form field, behaves as Enter. |
| ACT-8 | Stale ref guidance | Navigate away and back, then act on an old ref | Tool returns "ref … not found — call browser_snapshot to re-snapshot". |

### 4.5 Trusted input (chrome.debugger)

| ID | Objective | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| TRUST-1 ★ | Synthetic click is ignored by the trusted-only button | `browser_click {"ref":"<trusted-only ref>"}` (default) | `status: synthetic click ignored`. (Confirms default path is synthetic.) |
| TRUST-2 ★ | Trusted click works | `browser_click {"ref":"<trusted-only ref>","trusted":true}` | Debugging banner appears; `status: TRUSTED click received`; banner clears after. |
| TRUST-3 | DevTools conflict | Open DevTools on the tab, then `browser_click {…,"trusted":true}` | Tool surfaces a clear debugger-attach error (one debugger per tab); closing DevTools and retrying works. |

### 4.6 Tabs & history

| ID | Objective | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| TAB-1 ★ | List tabs | `browser_list_tabs` | Lists open tabs with ids; the active one marked `*`. |
| TAB-2 ★ | Switch active target | Open a second tab manually; `browser_select_tab {"id":<other>}` then `browser_snapshot` | Snapshot reflects the newly active tab (control target followed the switch). |
| TAB-3 | New tab | `browser_new_tab {"url":"https://example.com"}` | New active tab opens to example.com; tool returns its id. |
| TAB-4 | Close tab | `browser_close_tab {"id":<id>}` | That tab closes. |
| HIST-1 | Back/forward | Navigate A → B, then `browser_back`, then `browser_forward` | Tab returns to A, then forward to B. |

### 4.7 Waiting

| ID | Objective | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| WAIT-1 ★ | Wait for text | Click the "Load message in 1.5s" button, then `browser_wait_for {"text":"Async content loaded!"}` | Returns success once the text appears (within ~1.5 s). |
| WAIT-2 | Wait seconds | `browser_wait_for {"seconds":2}` | Returns after ~2 s. |
| WAIT-3 | Timeout | `browser_wait_for {"text":"this never appears"}` | After ~10 s, returns a clear "Timed out waiting for text" error. |

### 4.8 Security

| ID | Objective | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-1 ★ | Localhost-only bind | From another device on the LAN, try to connect to `ws://<this-machine-ip>:9234` | Connection refused (server binds `127.0.0.1` only). |
| SEC-2 | Token required | Connect a raw WS client to `127.0.0.1:9234` and send a hello with a wrong/absent token | Server closes the socket; no commands accepted. |

### 4.9 Real-world premise validation ★

| ID | Objective | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| REAL-1 ★ | Drive a site you're already logged into | Navigate to a site where you're signed in (email, dashboard, etc.); `browser_snapshot`; read/act on something that requires your session | The page shows your **logged-in** state and the agent can perceive/act on it — proving the bridge drives the *real default profile*, not a fresh one. |
| REAL-2 | Multi-step task | A short real task: navigate → snapshot → type into a search/field → click → wait_for → snapshot the result | Completes end to end without manual intervention. |
