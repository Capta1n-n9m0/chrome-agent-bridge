# Decisions — chrome-agent-bridge

Newest first. Format and rules: [`docs-writing-guide.md`](docs-writing-guide.md#decisions).
Cite an entry by date + title. Closed steps' entries are in `docs/decisions-archive/` (index below).

**Earlier decisions** (before 2026-10-21) live where they were made: the design specs in
`docs/specs/` and the step plans in `docs/plans/`. When one matters again, restate it here
as a dated entry and point back.

## Open decisions

None. Step 11b's were ruled on 2026-10-27 (#311, #320); the lists of earlier steps' open decisions, with
their rulings, are in the archive entries they cite and in git.

## Standing decisions

A decision that still governs how we work or what the product promises: one line, its date and title, and where
its full entry lives. Entries that only
settled a build detail of one stage, or that a later entry replaced, are not listed; they stay in the archive.
