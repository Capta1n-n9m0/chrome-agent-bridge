# Step 6 — as-built register

**Phase doc:** `docs/plans/2026-10-21-step6-daemon-and-protocol-v2.md` · **Steps dir:**
`docs/plans/2026-10-21-step6-daemon-and-protocol-v2-steps/` · **Baseline:** `1a92d95` (301 tests,
22 files; 21 tools).

One section per stage, appended at stage close, never rewritten; corrections are dated notes.

## Stage 0 — spec audit (closed 2026-10-22, commit 618a3ae)

- **Outputs:** `stage0-audit.md` (34 findings: 0 CRITICAL, 8 MAJOR, 17 MINOR, 9 NIT; D1 move map;
  builder ambiguities B1–B18), `stage0-verifier.md` (38 spot-checks re-executed: 33 confirmed,
  3 partial on wording, 0 refuted). Verdict DONE, verifier PASS-with-notes.
- **Measured baseline** (auditor and verifier each, on `1a92d95`): `npm test` 301 passed in 22 files
  (shared 1/4, server 8/86, extension 13/211); typecheck and build exit 0; 21 tools.
- **Decisions taken:** decisions.md · 2026-10-22 · #13–#17.
- **Phase-doc amendments:** A1–A4, A13 by the step agent; A5–A12 and the F1/F2/F7/F8/F23 checkbox
  additions and MUX-7 by the session agent, each with a dated note.
- **Open decisions (user):** #13 (no welcome → `VERSION`), #14 (detached daemon vs `taskkill /T`),
  #15 (non-4002 close handling).
- **Measured fact, candidate gotcha:** on Windows `spawn(…, {detached: true})` keeps the child in
  the parent's process tree; `taskkill /T` on a live parent kills it.
- **Estimate vs actual:** 1.5 h estimated; ~26 min agent wall time.
- **Needs the user's keyboard:** nothing yet; a `bridge.token` file or `BRIDGE_TOKEN` for the D6 wave
  (F21: none exists on this machine).
